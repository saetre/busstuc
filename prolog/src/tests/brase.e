In information systems engineering, conceptual models are 
constructed to assess existing information systems and work out 
requirements for new ones. As these models serve as a means for 
communication between customers and developers, it is paramount that 
both parties understand the models, as well as that the models form a 
proper basis for the subsequent design and implementation of the 
systems. New CASE environments are now experimenting with formal 
modeling languages and various techniques for validating conceptual 
models, though it seems difficult to come up with a technique that 
handles the linguistic barriers between the parties involved in a 
satisfactory manner. In this article, we discuss the theoretical 
basis of an explanation component implemented for the PPP CASE 
environment. This component integrates other validation techniques 
and provides a very flexible natural language interface to complex 
model information. It describes properties of the modeling language 
and the conceptual models in terms familiar to users, and the 
explanations can be combined with graphical model views. When models 
are executed, it can justify requested inputs and explain computed 
outputs by relating trace information to properties of the models.
