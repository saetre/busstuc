%% Example of Pragma rule (edited and commented)

%% Purpose: 

% if time requested is before  430 (today)  (" half past four" ) and
% time  now is after requested time + 1200 
% then change time requested to time requested + 1200 and
% change day to tomorrow

% The rule base operates on an intermediate meaning representation (TQL)
