%% INSTALLMENT

Java Program is stored in package

    regtopToBusTUC

currently under catalog

    javapackage/regtopToBusTUC/

For that to fuction properly, you should have

setenv CLASSPATH .:/usr/java/lib:/home/a/16/toreamb/javapackage:

in .cshrc

Java files are gathered under regtopToBusTUC/

and compiled by javac -encoding UTF-8 *.java

From then on, the compiled java program is run (from anywhere) by

    java regtopToBusTUC.ConvertRegTop


%% EXTRACTION

NB. NB. NB. NB.

If you only want to recreate regcut after a manual update of
route tables regdep or  regpas.
( extractreg will overwrite manual updates of internal route tables)

NEVER run this with more than 1 set without recompiling. !!!

% create_busstuc

% busstuc

   ?-create_regcut( <module name> ).
   ?-halt.
%  create_busstuc 

%%%%%%%%% End of short version




NB NB. If several routes sets are delivered at the same time, this
procedure must be followed for each individual set as if they were separate deliveries,

Remove files in the directory  tele/REGTOP/
Put REGTOP-files from TEAM in THE  directory  tele/REGTOP/


e.g.

R0021.DKO   
R0021.HPL   
R0021.TDA (v1.1) vs. R0021.TMS (v1.2)
R0021.TIX


% cd   ~/tele/REGTOP/


% java regtopToBusTUC.ConvertRegTop 

// wait

% ls

# Note the name of the created module, <module name> e.g.

   r0021_080201 



% cd  ~/tele/buster

% Extractshell <module name>   
    //  wait 2 minutes



EDIT database/topreg.pl to accommodate the new routes !!!!
//NB this can be done after all the route set has been extracted

% create_busstuc
