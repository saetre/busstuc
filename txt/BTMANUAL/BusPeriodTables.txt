%% THESE TABLES ARE SPECIFIC for a route period

They are stored in separate sub-dictionaries, one for each route period.

Internally, they are loaded into separate Prolog modules.



ROUTE  TABLES.

Route tables are delivered as data sets in text format from the bus company.

The format is in a standard called REGTOP and is a dump of company's
database. The relevant parts of this format is described in a separate document.


It is converted to internal tables by a program (  regtopToBusTUC.ConvertRegTop)


The tables are organised in domains and route periods.

The domains are typically 

 tt    Team trafikk  (buses)
 fb    Flybussen     (airbus)
 tmn   Trafikanten midt-norge routes
 gb    Gråkallbanen  (tram)
 kl    Klæburuten    (not implememted)

For each domain, there is a set of route period modules that describes
the set of departures within the dates of the route period.

Tables are all written in the format

name(arg1,...,argn).

The final dot is mandatory.

They are described  by a name followed by a list of argument domains
(types), followed by a few examples


These tables are generated, and need not be changed


The domains are

   ROUTE         route number (line)
   RID           tour identifier
   NAME          atomic name identifier
   STATION       station (bus-stop) name
   DAYCODE       day code (denotes actual  dates of a tour)
   DAYSTRING     charcter string denoting departure days
   DEPARTURETIME for tour (HHMM)
   LIST(Domain)  square bracket list of Domain  
   NUMBER        integer
   TOURTYPE      identifier of station trace of the tour
   STATIONNUMBER numer identifying station
   STATIONNAME   official printed station name
   DELAY         minutes after som start time

   -            not used


/// The tables (predicates) are organised into files which are
/// compiled during creation


// FILE REGBUS.PL


¤ REGBUS (ROUTE) 

A table of the route numbers occuring in the period module.

Example:

regbus(2).


¤ ROUTE (RID,ROUTE)

for each RID, the route number of the tour

Example:

route(bus_2_11,2,2).



// FILE REGHPL.PL//

HPL (STATIONNUMBER,STATION1,STATION2,STATIONNAME)   

Connects station numbers, internal names and printed name

Example:

hpl(16010035,anton_grevskotts_vei,anton_grevskotts_vei,'Anton Grevskotts vei').

Comment: STATION2 is an alias identifier, used for alternative bus companies.


The same station may be represented twice, one for each direction.
The 5.th digit in the station number signifies the direction

    (0    direction from center outwards to station
     1    direction from station inwards to center)





// FILE REGCOMP.PL

¤ COMPOSITE_STAT (NAME,LIST(NAME),STATION)   

Examples:

composite_stat(anton,[grevskotts, vei],anton_grevskotts_vei).
composite_stat(hospitalkirka,[],hospitalkirka).
composite_stat(prinsen,[kinosenter],prinsen_kinosenter).



¤ DEPARTUREDAY  (RID,TOURTYPE,DEPARTURETIME,DAYCODE)

Example:

departureday(bus_2_6101,749,723,1).

// FILE REGDKO.PL //

DKODATE (DATE,EMITDAY)

Example:

dkodate(100111, 1).


The route period started on the date(2010,01,11) which was a monday (day number 1).


¤ DKO (DAYCODE, - , - , - , - , - , - ,DAYSTRING)

Example:

dko(1,161,2,1111100,1111100,1111100,1111100,'11111001111100111110011111001111100111110011111001111100111110011111001111100111110011111001111100').

Comment:

 1 is the daycode. 
 The characters of the DAYSTRING denotes
     departure ('1')/no departure('0') for each successive day of the
     period


// FILE REGPAS.PL //


¤ NTOURSTOPS (TOURTYPE,LENGTH)

Defines the length (number of stations) inthe tourtype


ntourstops(12713,5).

¤  PASSES4 (TOURTYPE,STATION NUMBER,STATION,SEQNUMBER,ARR DELAY,DEP DELAY)

Example:

passes4(17326,16011035,anton_grevskotts_vei,22,15,16).

Tour-type 17326 passes station with number 16011035, and internal name  anton_grevskotts_vei
as number 22 in the sequence. It arrives at 15 minutes after start of tour , and departs 16 minutes
after start of tour.

Arrival at the first station and departure at last station
are  fictitious.



//// FILE REGCUT.PL ///

The file contains some auxiliary predicates for handling tours that
are formally defined as two adjacent tours on the same route.
It is implicit that the passenger needs not change bus.


¤ EX_NTOURSTOPS (New TOURTYPE,LENGTH)

Example:

ex_ntourstops(128,49).

The new TOURTYPE 128 has 49 station passings.


¤ EX_PASSES4 (New TOURTYPE,STATIONNUMBER,STATION,New SEQ,ARR DELAY, DEP DELAY)

Example:

ex_passes4(128,16011035,anton_grevskotts_vei,22,15,16). 

New tourtype 128 passes station number 16011035 with  internal name  anton_grevskotts_vei
as number 22 in the sequence. It arrives at 15 minutes after start of tour , and departs 16 minutes
after start of tour.


¤ EX_DEPARTUREDAY (RID,New TOURTYPE,DEPTIME,DAYCODE)

Example:

ex_departureday(bus_3_372,128,1932,1).


// The following tables may occur in the file, but are only used
temporarily during the creation of the final set of bus tables
(EX_DEPARTUREDAY, EX_PASSES3, EX_NTOURSTOPS):

 

¤ CUTLOOP_TRACE(STATION,TOURTYPE 1,TOURTYPE2)

This says that the STATION is a fictitious exchange station which is
defined formally  as two adjacent tours of tourtypes 1 and 2  with the same route.


Example:

cutloop_trace(munkegata_m2,14459,15562).


CUTLOOP_RID(STATION,RID 1,TOURTYPE 1,RID 2,TOURTYPE2,SEQ,DELAY)

Example:

cutloop_rid(munkegata_m2,bus_3_1258,14459,bus_3_1423,15562,17,20).

Contains a more detailed version of cutloop_trace.

SEQ is the length of the first leg, so as to adjust the sequence
number of the second leg when regarded as one adjacent tour.

DEALY is the waiting time at the exchange station, and is used to
compute the delays of  the second leg when regarded as one adjacent
tour.


%% XI is a conversion file from old pairs of tourtypes to a new tourtype

¤ XI  (TERM,New TOURTYPE) 

Example 1:

xi(pax(17326,14652,31,33),128). 


The combination of tourtypes 17326 and 14652 with sequence shift 31
and delay shift 33  gets a new tourtype 128

Example 2:

xi(pax(148077,0,0,0),580). 

No combination, just the old TOURTYPE 148077, got the new number 580.
