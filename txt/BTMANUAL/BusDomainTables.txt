%% These tables and predicates are general for a route domain, e.g TT
(Trondheim). They are independent of any time or date.

They are generated automatically by the creation process.




GENERAL DOMAIN TABLES (   // database/


// FILE REGSTR.PL

¤ STREETSTAT(STREET NAME,PRINTED NAME ,LOW NUMBER, HIGH NUMBER, STATION)

Examples:


streetstat(anders_buens_street,'Anders Buens gate',13,19,rosendal).
streetstat(anders_buens_street,'Anders Buens gate',2,9,anders_buens_gt).

streetstat(anton_grevskotts_street,'Anton Grevskotts veg',1,3,siemens). // the street

The LOW  and HIGH  numbers are intervals of street address numbers
pertinent to the station.

there may be overlaps and ambiguities, but they are resolved by the
search that takes the first that matches.
Street number letters are ignored.

Note that stations and streets may have the same name, but may not
coincide ( ref. 'Anders Buens gate',13,


//FILE  REGCOMPSTREET.PL

¤ COMPOSITE_ROAD(Name,LIST(NAME),STREET)

Examples:

composite_road(anders,[buens,street],anders_buens_street).
composite_road(anders,[buens_street],anders_buens_street).

composite_road(anton,[grevskotts,street],anton_grevskotts_street).
composite_road(anton,[grevskotts_street],anton_grevskotts_street).

Note that there may be several entries for the same composite name,
depending on whethere the name is written in one word or two words, e.g.

  Anders Buensgt
  Anders Buens gt

The name entity recognizer will treat various names for street as
equivalent:

Examples:

   Anders Buens  vei , Anders Buens gate
   

AUXILLIARY TABLES

The following tables are created during creation time, and are
supporting the name entity recognition:

// FILE AUXTABLES.PL


¤ STATBUS (STATION, LIST(ROUTE) )

Example:

statbus(anton_grevskotts_vei,[3,55,103]).

For each station, a list of routes that passes it

¤ BUSSTAT (ROUTE LIST(STATION) )

For each route, a list of stations  that it passes

¤ TRANSBUSLIST (ROUTE 1, ROUTE 2, LIST(STATION))

Example:

transbuslist(3,55,[anton_grevskotts_vei,astronomveien,dalsauneveien,einar_tambarskjelves_gt,fossegrenda,hovedterminalen,lerkendal_stadion,nordslettveien,nygård,prinsen_kinosenter,
                   professor_brochs_gate,sorgenfri,studentersamfundet_1,torget,utleirmark,valgrindveien]).

For each pair of routes, a list of stations that may be used for exchange, either way.
( Equivalent stations have been removed, i.e. possible exchange stations with neighbouring exchange stations on both sides)




// FILE  NAMEHASHTABLE.PL


¤  TOREDEF (NAME,TYPE,TARGET NAME)


Examples:

   toredef(nardosenteret,nil,nardosenteret).     %% full or part name/ not street

   toredef(erlends,street,erlends).              %% prefix street

   toredef(amalienlyst,streetname,amalienlyst).  %% full street name 

   toredef(skytter,streetstat,skytterveien).     %% partname of both street and station


NAME is a candidate name

TARGET NAME is the official result name

TYPE is a type of the name  
     (street : NAME is the first part of street name)
     (streetstat : NAME is both a part of a streetname and of a station)
     (streetname : NAME is the full streetname)
     (nil:     NAME is not a part of a streetname)


(In short, a search name will generate a set of misspelled name
variants, and the misspelled variants will be looked up  against NAME)


// FILE STATCOORD.PL

The table is used to draw the actual bus tours on a map.

¤ STATCOORD(STATION NUMBER,PRINTED NAME,XCOORD,YCOORD)

Examples:

statcoord(16010035,'Anton Grevskotts vei',570233.767,7031316.831).
statcoord(16011035,'Anton Grevskotts vei',570191.925,7031355.139).


There are two entries for this station. The first is for the direction
outwards from center. The second ("secondary direction") is the
direction inwards to the center.

XCOORD and YCOORD are metric GPS coordinates (UTM Zone 32 V) as used by the bus company. (%% RS-120727)
